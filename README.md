# Setup and Running
1. Locate the HTML file on your computer. It will have a filename ending in ".html" or ".htm".
2. Right-click on the file and choose "Open With" from the context menu.
3. Select a web browser from the list of installed programs. If your preferred web browser is not listed, click "Browse" and navigate to the executable file for the browser (e.g., "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" for Google Chrome).

Alternatively, you can simply double-click on the HTML file to open it in the default web browser.
